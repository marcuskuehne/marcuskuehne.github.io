marcuskuehne.de is :

Inspired by the idea of my collegue [Yasin GÃ¼zeldal][yasin] and from [Jonathan MCGlone][jonathan]. 

Build with [Jekyll][jekyll] and with the cool tutorial from [Taniarascia][tania].

Hosted on [GitHub][github] with [GitHub Pages][githubpages].

And it's never done - it's always **work in progress.**
