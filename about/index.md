#Hi, I am marcus kuehne.#
I have a education as a carpenter and studied communication psychology with the focus on human interaction.
Now i work as a user experience for [InVision][invision]. in the leipzig office. It's a very great team 
with challenging tasks and a lot of fun.

Beside this i go deeper in web development and want to learn more and more how the web works. 
On my page i want to show you step by step some of my private projects that i do for my family and friends. To help them 
with their business and to learn.

If you have any questions feel free to ask me.

Best regards, marcus
